As I will be away from the capital, I must charge someone with managing my throne, sceptre and seal on my behalf.\n\nMy Consort knows my mind better than anyone. With [SCOPE.sChar('regency_consort').GetHerHim] on the throne, it would be as if I had never left.\n\nOr perhaps such grave responsibility requires the loyal head of one of our greatest families,[SCOPE.sChar('regency_family_head').GetName], a noble equally committed to national stability and order."
